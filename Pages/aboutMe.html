            I am always looking to expand my toolbox of knowledge and experience with ways to provide solutions to real-world problems. 
            I enjoy finding ways to make processes more efficient, and streamline organization to help my team reach their goals. As an intern, 
            I was introduced to programming and how practical it is to implement in typical workplace processes. As an aerospace engineering major, 
            I had little exposure to programming besides MATLAB; I first witnessed its great utility when my coworker showed me a 
            Microsoft Excel VBA script he made that automates weeklly emails from a database. A 4-hour task was completed in just 2 minutes! I was 
            instantly hooked, and set out to learn how to make computers work for me. Since then, I have learned how to develop, deploy, and maintain 
            desktop and web applications, and have started a Masters of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA). I am proficient with the .NET Framework, .NET Core, Python, 
            Javascript, ASP.NET Core, and am always willing to add more to the list.
