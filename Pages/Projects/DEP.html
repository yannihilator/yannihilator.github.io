                <p>
                    Distributed Electrical Propulsion (DEP), is the concept of using multiple electrical motors spanned across an aircraftâ€™s wingspan. By increasing the amount of motors and propellers, the total lift over 
                    the wings increase significantly, while the drag only raises minimally. Current jet and personal planes consume large amount of fuel and emit both gaseous and noise pollution. A DEP plane avoids both these 
                    issues by using electricity as its main energy source. Multiple smaller motors are more efficient and provide more lift than a conventional single or 3 prop planes. In an incredibly turbulent and competitive 
                    time for airlines as legacy carriers are being challenged by younger budget carriers, operation costs will make the largest difference. The fluctuation of oil prices has always been one of the biggest concerns 
                    for the aviation industry, as in 2019 fuel costs had accounted for 23.7% of the operating costs of the industry (International Air Transport Association, 2019). In the auto industry, studies of electric 
                    vehicle costs have found an additional reduction in operation costs attributed to less maintenance needs of electric motor systems. Electric motor systems by design have fewer moving parts that need to be 
                    serviced on a regular basis. It can be inferred that an electric motor system in an aircraft will see similar reductions in maintenance needs and costs in addition to their reduced fuel costs and dependencies 
                    on oil price fluctuation.

                    In order to test this concept and contribute to its research, my senior design team and I designed, built, and tested a small-scale DEP aircraft over the span of one year. Along with investigating the concept
                    of DEP, the purpose of this project was to apply the skills and methodologies my team and I had learned throughout our aerospace and mechanical engineering degree programs and go through a formal engineering 
                    development lifecycle.
