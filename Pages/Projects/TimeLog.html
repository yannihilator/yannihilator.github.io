                <p>
                    At my current company, I am responsible for recording the hours that I work for specifically allotted charge numbers. 
                    For me, it was tedious and disorganized to record my activity throughout my workday in a spreadsheet, and make copies of
                    it week after week. I sought to use a time tracking application such as <i>Clockify</i>, but also wanted to keep my 
                    data local to my company-assigned machine. Thus, I created a simple .NET Core console application that assists with tracking my daily 
                    activities and saves the app data locally. It is extremely useful during hectic workdays where I am supporting multiple 
                    efforts and saves the headache of adding up my time at the end of the workday. Furthermore, developing this application in 
                    .NET Core is beneficial as I do all of my personal work on macOS, and I utilize this on my personal machine to track the time
                    spent on personal projects, as well as my Master's degree activity.

                <p>
                    <i>Time Log</i> is a .NET Core console application that times the duration spent working on specific projects or activities 
                    the user specifies. It stores the application data locally in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) format for protecting any proprietary 
                    information the user might wish to save. It is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">How To</h3>
                <p>
                    Once you have installed <i>Time Log</i>, start it up on your machine. The following screen will appear:
                    <img class="center" width="80%" height="100%" src="/Images/Projects/TimeLog/startScreen.png">
                    The start screen shows the current date, any time log entries the user has made today, and a set of actions 
                    the user can take from this screen. To perform an action to an existing entry, the user can type the ID number 
                    of the entry from the list to either edit its values or delete it; to start timing a new entry, the user can simply press the [Enter] key; to 
                    view the daily totals for each project/charge number, the user can type <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: medium">totals</span> in the command line 
                    and press the [Enter] key; to exit the application, the user can type <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: medium;">exit</span> in the command line and 
                    press the [Enter] key.
                </p>
